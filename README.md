# Stock-Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model to predict the movement of stock prices based on textual data from news articles, social media posts, and other sources of financial news and opinions. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in these texts, the model seeks to uncover insights into investor sentiment and market sentiment, which can be valuable indicators for making informed trading decisions.


Features

Sentiment Analysis on Financial Textual Data:

- Collected a large dataset of textual data from tweets related to stocks.
- Preprocessed the textual data by removing noise, tokenizing text into words or phrases, and applying techniques such as stemming and lemmatization to standardize text representations.
- Labeled the textual data with corresponding stock price movements (e.g., increase, decrease, or no change) over a specified time horizon to create a labeled dataset for supervised learning.

Model Training and Evaluation:

- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including:
     Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
     Logistic Regression
     Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     Random Forests
- Used classification algorithms to predict stock price movements based on textual sentiment.
  
- Performed model evaluation using metrics such as:
   Accuracy
   Precision
   Recall
   F1-score
   Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis

Portfolio Performance Metrics:

-  Assessed the performance of the trading strategy using financial metrics including:
    Sharpe Ratio: To measure risk-adjusted returns.
    Maximum Drawdown: To understand the largest loss from a peak to a trough.
    Number of Trades Executed: To analyze trading activity.
    Win Ratio: To evaluate the proportion of profitable trades.
   
Trading Strategy Visualization:

- Developed a trading strategy based on the sentiment analysis results.
- Identified buy and sell points according to the sentiment signals.
- Plotted these buy and sell points on a chart of stock price movements.
- Calculated the final portfolio value and returns.
